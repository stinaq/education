Train your problemsolving skills
==============================

Middle Way
---------
Given 2 int arrays, a and b, each length 3, return a new array length 2 containing their middle elements. 

Squirrel play
-------------
The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, return True if the squirrels play and False otherwise. 

Days old
--------
Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days. Compensate for leap days. Assume that the birthday and current date are correct dates (and no time travel). Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and today's date is 2 Jan 2012 you are 1 day old.

Aunt Stina's cats
-----------------
Aunt Stina has a huge number of cats and she often emails you about them. You need to be able to impress her in order to get into her will (she lives in a mansion along with all her cats and has no direct descendants). You have a large file of all her emails combined. She always ends them with "Love Stina" and then some information about the births and deaths of cats. And they always start with "Hello young rascal!". Here's the latest example she sent:    

> Hello you rascal!    
> Today I dropped one of my pure gold cups, it made a huge dent in the mahogony floor, very irritating. Also, the butler insists that Mr Whiskers was to blame, how silly.     
> Love Stina    
> Born: Pebbles, grey; Mr Purrlosconi, black
> Died: Apple, silver

What you need to do is create a database of all the cats. It should contain information about the name and color of the cat, but if a cat dies it should no longer stay in the database.

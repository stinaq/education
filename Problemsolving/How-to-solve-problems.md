=============================

1. Make sure you understand the problem
2. Understand the inputs
3. Understand the outputs
4. Understand relationships and work out some examples to try your solution on
5. How would you solve it if you didn't have a computer?
6. Try to simplify it and create a simple mechanical soulution
7. Don't optimize until you actually need it

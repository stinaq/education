Cascading style sheet
=====================

A set of defined ways to style HTML. Style sheets are a way to seperate the content from the styling of the content. 

The styling **cascades**, meaning that style rules can come from multiple places and the "strongest" one wins and sets the final look. Strongest here can mean:

*Being read the last by the browser (in what order the style sheets are loaded, or where in the document the rule is written)
*Having the highest specificity (What kind of style sheet you are using, or what kind of rule you are using)

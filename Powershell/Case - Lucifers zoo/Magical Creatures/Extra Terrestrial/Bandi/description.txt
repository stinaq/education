The Bandi are a humanoid species native to the planet Deneb IV in the Alpha Quadrant. The Bandi appealed to the United Federation of Planets #for membership in 2364 but were rejected because they had captured and enslaved an alien life form.

Perhaps #purely by coincidence, "Bandi" was the name of a vaguely ursine empathic parasite in an early Star Trek story premise by David Gerrold, who was involved in the development of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and who novelized "Encounter at Farpoint".
